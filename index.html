		<h2> Our mission </h2>

		<p> Back in grade 10, I launched my own cookie business driven by my passion for baking and a desire to make a positive impact during the Covid pandemic. Every Sunday for two years, I dedicated myself to baking over 100 cookies, pouring love and creativity into each batch. Through this endeavor, I successfully raised over 1,500 Canadian dollars for the mental health organization, Jack.org. It was incredibly fulfilling to see my hobby transform into a meaningful venture that contributed to a cause I deeply care about. As a first year university student I had to press pause on my business as I do not have an oven but am hopeful that I will be able to restart it next year. I am eager to continue pursuing my passion for baking and community service, and I look forward to the opportunity to once again make a positive impact through my cookie business.

			Hi there! 

			My name is Kassandra Lee and along with having a passion of baking, I have a strong desire to give back to my community. Mental health is something that is close to my heart and giving back to my community is something I cherish. Growing up going to an international school and playing hockey sheltered me for most of my life, something which I am extremely grateful for, but unfortunately is not a accurate representation of the world. This project was the birthchild of a passion and my alturistic character. Hope you guys enjoy!
